**Towards Physically-Consistent, Chaotic Spatiotemporal Dynamics with Echo State Networks**\
The aim of this study is to explore how echo state networks (ESNs) can be used in time-series forecasting of chaotic physics. We hypothesize that (a) a physics-informed ESN will produce more accurate and physically consistent spatiotemporal predictions of a chaotic system than a baseline network, and (b) that ESNs can scale to provide equivalent prediction accuracy on large-scale global weather models. We test this on a canonical Lorenz attractor as well as a large-scale chaotic weather forecasting model, focusing on best practices for scaling ESNs to large systems. We find that a traditional ESN, when properly tuned, can outperform our equivalent physics-informed methods. We also find that the ESN is capable of accurately predicting the global evolution of the atmospheric primitive equations beyond 50 hours.

[**Investigation on 1D Area Law and XXZ Model**](https://github.com/BiuSky7777/Reed2020-Thesis/blob/master/Paper/My_Final_College_Paper.pdf)\
An area law is investigated and verified for the von Neumann entanglement entropy of ground states in XXZ model, up to 14 qubits. The Schmidt coefficients of ground states of XXZ model with up to 13 qubits appear to be distributed exponentially. Slopes are studied to predict the slope of the Schmidt coefficients distribution of 14 qubits, and discrepancies are within 0.1 for 2 ≤ $\Delta$ ≤ 80. Quasi-approximate ground state projectors $K^t$ that can map random product states to ground states are also studied and Schmidt coefficients of these states also appear to be distributed exponentially up to 10 qubits.
